        <p>Wunderlust Travel is a travel agency known for booking, planning, and organizing travel plans to the most beautiful and gorgeous locations across the world. Their mission is to provide everyone with the vacation of their dreams through their commitment towards quick and easy planning.</p><br>
        <p>Contrary to their promise for quick and easy planning for everyone, the website had a significant lack of responsiveness - meaning the website did not function very well on any platform that wasnâ€™t desktop, and the layouts were jumbled.</p><br>
        <p>I did some research about the company to get an idea of what image they wanted to create. Then I analyzed the website to understand the functionality and how it was made. From there, the only thing left to do was to rewrite each function in a manner that was more flexible and had room for adaptability.</p><br>
        <p>Overall, the website had gone from desktop-exclusive to all-inclusive. Users on any mobile and tablet devices were able to access the website, which led to an increase in website engagement and brand recognition.</p>
