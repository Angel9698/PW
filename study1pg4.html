        <p>COSRX is a Korean skincare brand founded in 2013. With proven ingredients and extensive research, they strive to provide friendly cosmetic products to fulfill their customer’s daily skincare needs, and value trust, minimalism, and transparency.</p><br>
        <p>In spite of the focus on minimalism and transparency, some pages of the website were designed in a way that negates these values in favor of increasing sales. The reviews page contained a ton of unnecessary elements that users do not engage with, and the stores page hid very important information at the very bottom of the page, where it was very easy to miss.</p><br>
        <p>I did some research about the company to get an idea of what their brand looks like and know what values they are committed to. Then I chose a color palette that I felt best represented these values. After that, I conducted a test to give the website a score based on how easy it is to use, access, and navigate using Nielson’s Usability Heuristics as general guidelines. From there, the only thing left to do was to fix the issues that were uncovered after testing was done while maintaining the image COSRX was trying to go for.</p><br>
        <p>The pages for the website were designed with the values of trust, minimalism, and transparency in mind. To align with these values, several elements that were unnecessary were removed from the reviews page, as well as the top and bottom of the pages. Additionally, important links and information were emphasized  more and positioned in places that were easy to see. </p>
