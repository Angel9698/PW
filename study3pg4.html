        <p>A farmer and his wife sell their crops in a small store in the countryside. Due to the increasing spread of technology and its use, they decided to invest in a simple website that lists all the crops they have for sale.</p><br>
        <p>Theft has become increasingly common over the years in their lands. The crops for sale were moved from an open environment to an enclosed area to preserve the condition and improve security. As a result, potential buyers are unable to browse the selection of crops.</p><br>
        <p>The sole purpose of the website was to display in a visual format the items for sale. Therefore, images of all the fruits and vegetables were compiled in a list, along with their names, grouped by category. After the mobile format was established, it was then modified to accommodate larger screens.</p><br>
        <p>The website is very simple with only a list containing all the fruits and vegetables that are for sale. With the customer base primarily having access to mobile over desktop, the website was designed with a priority on mobile functionality. However, the website can accommodate larger screens as well. The introduction of the website in the modern world helped to spread their name and led to an increase in customer loyalty.</p>
